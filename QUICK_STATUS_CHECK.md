# Quick Status Check

## 🚀 Fastest Way to Check

### 1. Check Zapier (30 seconds)
1. Go to: https://zapier.com/app/dashboard
2. Click your Zap
3. Click **"Task History"**
4. Look for recent tasks (green = success, red = error)

### 2. Check Google Drive (1 minute)
1. Go to: https://drive.google.com
2. Look for: `TechFlow_Solutions_slide.pdf` (or your company name)

### 3. Check Render Logs (if needed)
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Click your service → **"Logs"**
3. Look for webhook processing messages

## ✅ Success Looks Like:

**Zapier:**
- ✅ Green checkmarks on all steps
- ✅ Task completed successfully

**Google Drive:**
- ✅ PDF file appears in your folder
- ✅ File name matches company name

**Render:**
- ✅ Logs show "Processing complete. Success: True"
- ✅ No error messages

## ❌ If Nothing Happened:

1. **Check Zap is ON** (not paused)
2. **Check Status = "Ready"** (exact match)
3. **Wait 1-2 minutes** (can take time)
4. **Create new entry** (sometimes helps)
